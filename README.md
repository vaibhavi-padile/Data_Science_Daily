Project Overview (from day 1 to Day 12)

This project focuses on analyzing long-term climate trends in Mumbai, India, using historical weather data to uncover patterns in temperature and rainfall. The objective was to transform a raw, inconsistent climate dataset into a clean, analysis-ready format and build an interactive dashboard that enables intuitive exploration of climate behavior across years and seasons. The project emphasizes real-world data challenges, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and data storytelling through visualization.
